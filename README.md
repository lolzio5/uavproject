# uavproject

This project uses Yolov3-tiny to detect obstacles on images using the detect.py file. It is currently trained for a forest environment with numerous trees. 

The plan.py file is then able to plan the most efficient path around an obstacle, and prints it out. 

This project is still a work in progress, having to use the output of the plan.py file to control a real drone.
